    description: "Simon, Welcome to Mount Holly. You may not remember but I have fond memories of your many visits here as a young boy and I hope these rooms provide you with as much amusement as it did in those lost summer days. By the time you read this I will assume you are fully aware of my last wishes and all the details of the bequest. Please do not mistake my intentions in giving you this challenge as a lack of confidence. I assure you, nothing could have been further from my mind when I chose you as my heir. With that said, there are a few ground rules of this commision covered in the fine print of my will that I feel I should bring to your attention: NO TOOLS OR ITEMS MAY BE BROUGHT ONTO THE ESTATE FROM THE OUTSIDE. TOOLS & ITEMS FOUND ON THE ESTATE MAY NOT BE TAKEN OFF THE ESTATE. YOU MAY NOT STAY OVERNIGHT. I don't suspect that any of these stipulations should prove an impediment for someone as resourceful as yourself but it is very important to me that you \"start fresh\" each morning and not rely on the successes of the previous day. One final word of advice: Do not assume the rooms you find today will be the same rooms you find tomorrow. These grounds have provided me a home for the last half century and even I am uncertain of which room lies beyond any particular door. Your grandmother used to say, \"Don't go where the path leads. Abandon the path and go where you want it to lead.\" With all my love and wishes, Best of luck, Herbert S. Sinclair",
