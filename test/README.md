- Validates checkbox, section, and subsection state management

#### Dependency Resolution Tests (`test/dependency-resolution.test.js`)

- **14 tests** covering the progressive disclosure system
- Tests dependency validation logic
- Validates visibility filtering for sections, subsections, checkboxes, and information items

#### Mystery System Tests (`test/mystery-system.test.js`)

- **16 tests** covering mystery detection, unlocking, and display logic
- Tests both keyword-based and click-based mystery unlocking
- Validates mystery state management and screen reader announcements

#### Progress Calculation Tests (`test/progress-calculation.test.js`)

- **14 tests** covering progress tracking at all levels
- Tests section, subsection, and overall progress calculations
- Validates edge cases like empty sections and division by zero

### Integration Tests (10 tests)

#### Complete User Workflows (`test/integration.test.js`)

- **10 tests** covering end-to-end user scenarios
- Tests complete user journeys from start to finish
- Validates data loading, aggregation, and administrative functions
- Tests state persistence and recovery scenarios

### User Acceptance Tests (12 tests)

#### Progressive Disclosure Validation (`test/user-acceptance.test.js`)

- **12 tests** covering real-world user scenarios
- Tests spoiler prevention and content revelation
- Validates mystery discovery through both methods
- Tests progress tracking accuracy and responsive design simulation
- Validates accessibility features and keyboard navigation

- **Passing**: 77 (100%)
- **Failing**: 0
- **Test Files**: 6
- **Coverage Areas**: All major functionality covered

## Testing Approach

The tests use Vitest with happy-dom environment for fast, reliable testing. The application code is evaluated in a controlled context to enable comprehensive unit testing of the Alpine.js application without requiring a full browser environment.

### Key Testing Strategies

1. **Isolation**: Each test is isolated with proper setup and teardown
2. **Mocking**: External dependencies (localStorage, DOM APIs) are properly mocked
3. **Realistic Data**: Tests use realistic data structures that mirror actual usage
4. **Edge Cases**: Tests cover error conditions and edge cases
5. **User Perspective**: User acceptance tests validate functionality from the user's viewpoint

## Quality Assurance

The test suite ensures:

- **Functionality**: All features work as specified
- **Reliability**: Error conditions are handled gracefully
- **Usability**: User workflows are smooth and intuitive
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers and keyboard navigation work properly
- **Performance**: State management is efficient and responsive
- **Maintainability**: Code is well-tested and changes can be validated quickly

This comprehensive testing approach ensures the application meets all requirements and provides a high-quality user experience.
